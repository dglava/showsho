    """Runs the program in steps.

    First it sets up the cache directory which optionally already
    contains data about the shows. Useful to speed things up and
    to make it work offline.
    Then it gets a list of shows, which contains dictionaries with
    information about the show. Along the way, it additionally checks
    if the program is being run for the first time which is used to
    update the information later on.
    Once the list is available, it then creates a new list which is
    holding Show() objects. Show() objects are instantiated with
    data from the dictionaries in the list and contain methods to
    determine additional data about the show, as well as a method to
    dump a new dictionary with updated show information (saving a
    cache file).

    Finally, it runs through each show object from the list and
    displays the information. Depending on the options which are passed
    to main, it might also update the show's information, download them
    or only print shows that are airing.
